# Negotiation Agent Utility Analysis and Feedback Preparation
This project analyzes the performance of automated negotiation agents using real-world competition data from the [Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) 2019](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Results_from_the_Automated_Negotiating_Agents_Competition_ANAC_2019_/19161851). 

Using Python and data processing techniques, this project generates structured summaries of agent performance metrics â€” including utility rankings, agreement rates, and negotiation outcomes â€” for use in downstream agentic AI feedback systems.

## Objective

To extract, summarize, and prepare negotiation performance data that can serve as training material for feedback-driven AI agents, aiding future work in negotiation coaching and autonomous decision-making support systems.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pandas** (for data handling and aggregation)
- **openpyxl** (for Excel reading)
- **NLP concepts** (summarization and prompt formatting)


## Dataset Source

- **Competition:** Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) 2019
- **Link:** [4TU.ResearchData Repository](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Results_from_the_Automated_Negotiating_Agents_Competition_ANAC_2019_/19161851)

## Installation
 **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

---

## How It Works

- **Step 1:** Load negotiation and agent utility data from multiple sources (Excel and CSVs).
- **Step 2:** Process agent performance metrics (average utility, agreement rate).
- **Step 3:** Rank agents and identify top performers and lowest performers.
- **Step 4:** Analyze total negotiation sessions, success vs. failure outcomes.
- **Step 5:** Format outputs as structured feedback prompts ready for future agentic AI integration.

## Example Output

Total negotiation sessions: 10500

Agreements reached: 7362 (70.11%)

Failed negotiations: 3138 (29.89%)

Top Agent: AgentGG
    - Sessions: 1000
    - Avg Utility: 0.7574
    - Agreement Rate: 81.00%

ðŸ“ˆ Top 5 Agents by Average Utility:
Agent     Sessions  Avg_Utility  Agreements  Agreement Rate
AgentGG        1000     0.757399         810           0.810
KakeSoba       1000     0.743267         796           0.796
