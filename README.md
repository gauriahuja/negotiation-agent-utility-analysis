# Negotiation-agent-utility-analysis
This project analyzes the performance of automated negotiation agents using real-world competition data from the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) 2019.
Using Python and NLP techniques, the project processes negotiation dialogue records, calculates agent utility scores, agreement rates, and summarizes outcomes. The resulting structured outputs are prepared for future integration with agentic AI feedback systems, helping simulate and guide negotiation decision-making.
